# BadPostureAlert with MoveNet
-The project aims to detect human posture and can differentiate between good and bad posture. This is an idea for monitoring sitting posture of people in working office and give an alarm when they have inappropriate posture, therefore, it can help to protect worker's health. <br />
-The project uses MediaPipe Pose Landmarker for landmark detection and then calculate the angle betweeb nose-shoulder, shoulder-hip to decide if the posture is good or bad.<br />
